**Build Status:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS

## üêõ Bugs Identified and Fixed

### **Bug #1: File Sends Immediately Without Preview**
**Problem:** When user clicked attach button and selected a file, it immediately started sending without showing a preview or confirmation.

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `onAttachFileClicked()` to store the file in `selectedFileToSend` variable
- Display file info in input field: `"üìé filename.jpg (350 KB)"`
- Set input field to non-editable
- Change send button text to "Send File"
- Disable attach button while file is selected
- Modified `onSendMessage()` to check if `selectedFileToSend != null` and call `sendFile()` only when Send button is clicked

**Result:** ‚úÖ File now shows in input box like WhatsApp, user must click Send to transmit

---

### **Bug #2: GUI Freezes During File Receive**
**Problem:** When receiving a 350KB file, the GUI froze for 5+ minutes showing "Receiving..." and became unresponsive.

**Root Cause:** File decryption was happening on UI thread inside `Platform.runLater()` block

**Fix Applied:**
- `handleFileEnd()` already uses `executor.submit()` for background processing
- Moved `fileTransferHandler.receiveAndDecryptFile()` to background thread
- Only UI updates wrapped in `Platform.runLater()`
- Progress updates in `handleFileChunk()` use Platform.runLater for UI-only code

**Result:** ‚úÖ File decryption happens in background, GUI stays responsive

---

### **Bug #3: No Way to View or Download Received Files**
**Problem:** After file was received, it auto-prompted save dialog. If user cancelled, file was lost. No way to download again or preview file details.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `receivedFilesData` Map to store decrypted file bytes in memory
- Modified `handleFileEnd()` to store file data instead of auto-prompting save
- Modified `addReceivedFileMessage()` to make file bubble clickable
- Added `downloadReceivedFile()` method triggered by clicking file message
- File messages show "üíæ Click to download" status
- Added hover effects (blue border) to indicate clickable
- Save dialog only appears when user clicks the file message

**Result:** ‚úÖ Files stay in memory, user can download anytime by clicking message bubble

---

### **Bug #4: File Chunks Not Processing Correctly**
**Problem:** File receiving was stuck, chunks weren't being processed properly.

**Root Cause:** Blocking operations on UI thread and potential threading issues

**Fix Applied:**
- All file operations (`prepareFileForTransfer`, `receiveAndDecryptFile`) run in `executor.submit()`
- Added `Thread.sleep(10)` between chunk sends to avoid network flooding
- Chunk reception happens on background network thread
- Only status updates use `Platform.runLater()`
- Proper exception handling in all async operations

**Result:** ‚úÖ Chunks process smoothly without blocking

## üéØ How It Works Now

### **Sending a File (Fixed Flow)**

```
1. User clicks üìé attach button
   ‚Üí FileChooser opens
   
2. User selects file (e.g., image.jpg - 350KB)
   ‚Üí Validates size (<100MB) ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Shows in input box: "üìé image.jpg (350 KB)"
   ‚Üí Input field becomes non-editable
   ‚Üí Send button changes to "Send File"
   ‚Üí Attach button disabled
   
3. User clicks "Send File" button
   ‚Üí `onSendMessage()` checks `selectedFileToSend != null`
   ‚Üí Calls `sendFile()` in background thread
   ‚Üí Chunks file into 1MB pieces (350KB = 1 chunk)
   ‚Üí Encrypts chunk with BlockCipher
   ‚Üí Sends FILE_START, FILE_CHUNK(s), FILE_END
   ‚Üí Shows progress: "Sending file: 100%"
   ‚Üí Displays sent file message bubble
   
4. Input field resets, attach button re-enabled
```

---

### **Receiving a File (Fixed Flow)**

```
1. FILE_START message arrives
   ‚Üí `handleFileStart()` stores metadata
   ‚Üí Shows: "üì• Receiving file: image.jpg (350 KB)"
   
2. FILE_CHUNK messages arrive
   ‚Üí `handleFileChunk()` adds to chunk list
   ‚Üí Updates status: "Receiving file: 100%"
   ‚Üí NO GUI FREEZE (background thread) ‚úÖ
   
3. FILE_END message arrives
   ‚Üí `handleFileEnd()` runs in executor.submit() ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Verifies signature
   ‚Üí Decrypts all chunks (background thread) ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Reassembles file bytes
   ‚Üí Verifies checksum
   ‚Üí STORES in receivedFilesData Map ‚úÖ
   ‚Üí Shows clickable file message bubble
   ‚Üí Message says: "üíæ Click to download" ‚úÖ
   
4. User clicks file message bubble
   ‚Üí `downloadReceivedFile()` called
   ‚Üí Save dialog appears
   ‚Üí User chooses location
   ‚Üí File saved to disk
   ‚Üí Shows: "üíæ File saved: image.jpg"
```
