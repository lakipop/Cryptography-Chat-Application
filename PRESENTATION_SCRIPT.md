Hello everyone. My name is Lakindu Sadumina.
I am from Group 06, and today I will show you our cryptography project.
We created our own encryption algorithm called "Fleurdelyx".

This is a chat application. We can send encrypted messages securely.
Let me show you how the encryption works step by step.
I will use my own name "Lakindu Sadumina" as the example message.
```

## üìå SECTION 2: ENCRYPTION PROCESS DEMO (4-5 minutes)
### üñ•Ô∏è **[SHOW ON SCREEN + SPEAK]**

### **Step 1: Generate Random IV**
```
First, the system generates a random IV.
IV means Initialization Vector. It is 16 bytes.
[Point to IV on screen]
Every time we encrypt, we get different IV.
This is why same message looks different each time.
This is called "semantic security".
```

- Example: `BC F2 A3 BC BD 72 4C AF E8 A1 9C 73 4F 2D 8B 61`

---

### **Step 2: Convert Message to Bytes**
```
Next, we convert my name to bytes.
"Lakindu Sadumina" becomes 16 bytes in hexadecimal.
[Point to hex values]
Each letter has a number. For example:
L = 4C
a = 61
k = 6B
All 16 characters become 16 bytes.
```

**[VISUAL HINT: Show conversion on screen]**
```
Text: L   a   k   i   n   d   u  (space) S   a   d   u   m   i   n   a
Hex:  4C  61  6B  69  6E  64  75  20     53  61  64  75  6D  69  6E  61
```

---

### **Step 3: Pre-Whitening (XOR with IV)**
```
Now we mix the message with the IV.
We use XOR operation. This is like mixing colors.
[Point to XOR results]
For example:
4C XOR BC = F0
61 XOR F2 = 93
After XOR, the data looks completely random already.
This is the first protection layer.
```

**[VISUAL HINT: Show a few XOR calculations]**
```
Position 0: 4C XOR BC = F0
Position 1: 61 XOR F2 = 93
Position 2: 6B XOR A3 = C8
```

---

### **Step 4: Multi-Round Transformation (Main Part)**
```
Now comes the main encryption.
We do 10 rounds of transformation.
Each round has TWO steps:
1. Split and shuffle the data
2. Transform each byte
Let me show Round 1 as example.
```

---

#### **Round 1 - Part A: Split and Shuffle**
```

First, we split the 16 bytes into 5 chunks.
The sizes are different: 5 bytes, 3 bytes, 3 bytes, 2 bytes, 3 bytes.
Then we shuffle them using Fisher-Yates algorithm.
We use a seed number: Round number times 31, plus key sum.
Seed = 1 √ó 31 + 1589 = 1620
With this seed, we shuffle the chunks.

[Point to shuffled result]

Now the chunks are in different order.
This makes the pattern unpredictable.
```

**[VISUAL HINT: Show chunk splitting and shuffle pattern]**
```
BEFORE shuffle:
[Chunk0: 5 bytes][Chunk1: 3 bytes][Chunk2: 3 bytes][Chunk3: 2 bytes][Chunk4: 3 bytes]

AFTER shuffle (pattern: [3,1,4,0,2]):
[Chunk3][Chunk1][Chunk4][Chunk0][Chunk2]
```

---

#### **Round 1 - Part B: Byte Transformation**
```
After shuffling, we transform each byte.

We use this formula:
New byte = (old byte + shift value) mod 256

The shift value depends on:
- Round number
- Position in data
- Secret key

For example, in Round 1:
Shift = 5 + (1 √ó 3) + key byte = 8 + key byte

Each byte gets different shift value.

After transformation, Round 1 is complete.
```

**[VISUAL HINT: Show one or two byte transformations]**
```
Byte at position 0: 06 + 87 = 93 (in hex: 5D)
Byte at position 1: 22 + 91 = 113 (in hex: 71)
```

---

#### **Rounds 2-10: Continue Process**
```
We repeat this process 10 times.

Each round:
- Splits data into different number of chunks (2 to 5)
- Uses different shuffle pattern
- Uses bigger shift values

Round 2 uses 4 chunks.
Round 3 uses 3 chunks.
And so on...

By Round 10, the data is completely scrambled.

Nobody can recognize the original message.
```

**[VISUAL HINT: Just show final result]**
```
After Round 10: [2F, 8A, E3, 47, B9, 1C, D6, 5E, A2, F4, 6B, C8, 91, 3D, 7F, BA]
```

---

### **Step 5: Dual IV Embedding**
```
Now we have encrypted data.

But we need to hide the IV also.

We use TWO methods to hide IV:

Method 1: XOR Obfuscation
We XOR the IV bytes at secret positions in the ciphertext.
Only the key can find these positions.

Method 2: Physical Insertion
We break IV into 4 pieces.
We insert these pieces at calculated positions.

[Point to interleaved structure]

Now the IV is hidden inside the encrypted data.

Attacker cannot find the IV without the key.
```

**[VISUAL HINT: Show interleaved structure diagram]**
```
Final structure:
[Cipher][IV-piece1][Cipher][IV-piece2][Cipher][IV-piece3][Cipher][IV-piece4][Cipher]
```

---

### **Step 6: Base64 Encoding**
```
Finally, we encode everything with Base64.
This makes the encrypted data safe to send over network.


This is the final encrypted message.
It looks random. Nobody can read it.
Only the person with correct key can decrypt.
```

---

## üìå SECTION 3: SIGNATURE VERIFICATION (1 minute)
### üó£Ô∏è **[SPEAK]**

```
Now, how does the receiver know this message is really from me?
We use RSA digital signature.

[Point to RSA process on screen]

Before sending, I sign the message with my private key.
The receiver verifies with my public key.

If signature is valid, they know:
1. The message is from me
2. Nobody changed the message

This protects against "man-in-the-middle attack".
Even if someone intercepts the message, they cannot change it.
Because they don't have my private key.
```

---

## üìå SECTION 4: SECURITY BENEFITS (2 minutes)
### üó£Ô∏è **[SPEAK WITH CONFIDENCE - NATURAL FLOW]**

```
Now let me talk about the security benefits. Our algorithm protects what we call CIA - that's Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authentication. Let me explain each one simply.

First is Confidentiality. The message is encrypted, so nobody can read it without the key. We use a 128-bit key, which means 2 to the power of 128 possible keys. That's 340 undecillion combinations - a huge number! So brute force attack is basically impossible. Next is Integrity. We use RSA digital signature for this. If someone changes even 1 bit in the message, the signature breaks immediately. So the receiver will know the message was modified. And third is Authentication. The digital signature proves who sent the message. Only I have my private key, so only I can create a valid signature for my messages.

[Pause - take a breath]

Now let me give you some real examples of how our system protects against actual attacks. First example - Man-in-the-Middle attack. Imagine an attacker intercepts my message to the server. What happens? Well, they cannot read it because it's encrypted. They cannot change it because the signature will break. And they cannot replay an old message because each message has a unique random IV. So our system completely blocks this attack.

Second example - Frequency Analysis attack. In old ciphers like Caesar cipher, the letter E appears most frequently, so attackers can guess patterns by counting letters. But in our cipher, we use multi-chunk shuffling, position-dependent transformation, and random IV. Look at my name - the letter 'a' appears 4 times, right? But all four encrypt to completely different values! So there's no pattern to analyze.

Third example - Known Plaintext attack. Sometimes an attacker knows some plaintext and ciphertext pairs. But in our system, the same plaintext gives different ciphertext every time because of the random IV. For example, "Lakindu Sadumina" encrypted now gives one result, but if I encrypt it again, completely different result! This is what we call semantic security.
```

## üìå SECTION 5: CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
### üó£Ô∏è **[SPEAK - CONFIDENT FINISH]**

```
So in summary, our Fleurdelyx algorithm uses 10 rounds of encryption with multi-chunk shuffling using Fisher-Yates algorithm, dual IV embedding for extra security, and RSA signature for authentication. It protects confidentiality, integrity, and authentication - the CIA principles. And it successfully resists modern attacks like man-in-the-middle, frequency analysis, and known plaintext attacks.

Best part? It works in real-time for secure communication. You can see it running right here in our chat application.

Thank you. My part is finish. now I will pass it to my teammate who will explain the decryption process.
