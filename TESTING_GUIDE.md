## 📊 Performance Checks

| Test | Before Fix | After Fix | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **350KB Image** | 5+ min freeze | < 2 seconds | ✅ |
| **File Preview** | No preview | Shows in input | ✅ |
| **GUI Responsive** | Frozen | Fully responsive | ✅ |
| **Download Option** | None | Click to download | ✅ |
| **Hover Effect** | None | Blue border | ✅ |

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: File doesn't show in input box
**Solution:** Make sure you actually selected a file (didn't cancel dialog)

### Problem: "Send File" button doesn't send
**Solution:** Check if symmetric key exchange completed (connection established)

### Problem: Received file won't download
**Solution:** File data is stored in memory - if you restart, it's gone. Receive the file again.

### Problem: File size > 100MB
**Expected:** Error message "File too large! Maximum size is 100MB"

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

All tests pass if:
- ✅ File preview shows before sending
- ✅ No GUI freeze during 350KB transfer
- ✅ Received files are clickable
- ✅ Downloaded files are identical to originals
- ✅ Both directions work (client→server, server→client)
